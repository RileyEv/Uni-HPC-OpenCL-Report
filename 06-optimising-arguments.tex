\paragraph{Reducing the number of kernel arguments}
There are two ways to reduce the number of arguments that are buffers. One method is to initialise a single buffer to store the whole grid and access it as a 3D array. Another is to create a structure on the device, which stores pointers to the buffers. The latter has some caveats: a new kernel would need to be created to convert the buffers to pointers on the device. Another kernel would be needed to perform a pointer swap. 

The results from attempting both of these methods can be seen in Table~\ref{table:fixing-slow-host}. From the results it appears that the second option is faster. However, in the next section, when optimising the reduction, the first option produces faster results.
